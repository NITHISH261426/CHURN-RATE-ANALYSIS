# CHURN-RATE-ANALYSIS
An end-to-end customer churn analysis project using Power BI. It leverages DAX for complex KPIs and Power Query for data transformation to build a dynamic dashboard. The goal is to translate data into actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for any subscription-based business. This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the key drivers of churn. The goal is to move beyond simple observations to uncover actionable, data-driven insights that can help a business formulate effective retention strategies.

The final output is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that not only visualizes the data but also tells a clear story about why customers leave and what can be done about it.
