# CHURN-RATE-ANALYSIS
An end-to-end customer churn analysis project using Power BI. It leverages DAX for complex KPIs and Power Query for data transformation to build a dynamic dashboard. The goal is to translate data into actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for any subscription-based business. This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the key drivers of churn. The goal is to move beyond simple observations to uncover actionable, data-driven insights that can help a business formulate effective retention strategies.

The final output is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that not only visualizes the data but also tells a clear story about why customers leave and what can be done about it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

*   **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and all visualizations.
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to create complex measures for dynamic calculations (e.g., Churn Rate,  customer counts).
*   **Power Query :** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and creating conditional columns (e.g., Tenure Groups).

## üìÇ Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Customer Churn" dataset, widely available on platforms like Kaggle. It contains demographic, account, and service information for over 7,000 customers.
