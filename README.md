# CHURN-RATE-ANALYSIS
An end-to-end customer churn analysis project using Power BI. It leverages DAX for complex KPIs and Power Query for data transformation to build a dynamic dashboard. The goal is to translate data into actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for any subscription-based business. This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the key drivers of churn. The goal is to move beyond simple observations to uncover actionable, data-driven insights that can help a business formulate effective retention strategies.

The final output is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that not only visualizes the data but also tells a clear story about why customers leave and what can be done about it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

*   **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and all visualizations.
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to create complex measures for dynamic calculations (e.g., Churn Rate,  customer counts).
*   **Power Query :** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and creating conditional columns (e.g., Tenure Groups).

## üìÇ Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Customer Churn" dataset, widely available on platforms like Kaggle. It contains demographic, account, and service information for over 7,000 customers.

## Key Findings & Actionable Insights

My analysis revealed several critical insights that directly inform retention strategy:

*   **The Fiber Optic Paradox:** While being a premium service, customers with **Fiber Optic** internet have an alarmingly high churn rate of **42%**, more than double that of DSL users (19%). This suggests a mismatch between price, performance expectations, and service reliability.
*   **Payment Friction is a Major Driver:** Customers using manual payment methods like **Electronic Check** churn at a rate of **45%**. In contrast, those on **Automatic Payments** have a much lower churn rate of just 15%.
*   **The "Leaky Bucket" of New Customers:** The **Line & Stacked Column Chart** clearly shows that the highest churn rates occur within the first 12 months. This is especially risky as this new customer segment also contributes a significant portion of the total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).
*   **Support Tickets as a Leading Indicator:** A customer's likelihood to churn increases dramatically with the number of tech support tickets filed. Customers with 3 or more tickets have a churn rate exceeding **65%**, making support interaction a powerful predictive signal.


## üìä Power BI Report

To present findings in an accessible and interactive format, a dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI. This dashboard allows stakeholders to dynamically filter the data and explore sales trends on their own.
